[_NET_ACTIVE_WINDOW moves windows if necessary
Joachim Breitner <mail@joachim-breitner.de>**20080402143811
 This makes EWMH behave a bit more like metacity: If _NET_ACTIVE_WINDOW is
 received and the window is not on the current worspace, it is brought here 
 (instead of the workspace switched to the other one). So for example, if you
 click on the pidgin icon in the panel and the buddy list is already open some
 where it is moved here.
] {
hunk ./XMonad/Hooks/EwmhDesktops.hs 103
- ---  * _NET_ACTIVE_WINDOW (activate another window)
+--  * _NET_ACTIVE_WINDOW (activate another window, possibly moving to the current desktop)
hunk ./XMonad/Hooks/EwmhDesktops.hs 136
- -               windows $ W.focusWindow w
+               windows $ W.focusWindow w . W.shiftWin (W.tag (W.workspace (W.current s))) w
}
