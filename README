darcswatch

Â© 2008 Joachim Breitner <mail@joachim-breitner.de>

This program tracks darcs patches and repositories, giving
an overview over their state (applied or not applied).

The patches are expected to come in via the mailfilter.sh
program, which checks the gpg signature and stores the
patches in the appropriate place.

The main program then downloads the repository inventories
and compares the mailed patches against the repository. It
summaries their status per submitter and per repository.

The program expects a directory as a parameter and will read
the config file therin for configuration. An example
configuration is included.

darcsweb uses modules from these non-standard packages:
 * xhtml
 * network
 * HTTP
 * Crypto
 * parsec

There are a lot of open issues, and help is very
appreciated. A non exlusive list of TODO items is:

 * Support for tagged repositories (fetching older
   inventories)
 * Cache the inventories and only update when needed, by
   issuing a HEAD request.
 * Add a download link to each pach
 * Add the diff to each patch, with some javascript
   hiding/unhiding.
 * Cabalize the program.
 * Detect inverted patches and treat specially (e.g. an
   unapplied patch where the user also submitted an inverted
   patch can be considered obsolete)
 * Nicer output (CSS magic!)
 * (Maybe) Add repositores per gpg signed command

When commiting patches, please make sure that they work with
the version of ghc in the latest debian stable release, at
the moment ghc6.6, and compatible libraries.
