darcswatch

This program tracks darcs patches and repositories, giving
an overview over their state (applied or not applied).

The patches are expected to come in via the mailfilter.sh
program, which checks the gpg signature and stores the
patches in the appropriate place.

The main program then downloads the repository inventories
and compares the mailed patches against the repository. It
summaries their status per submitter and per repository.

The program expects a directory as a parameter and will read
the config file therin for configuration. An example
configuration is included.

darcsweb uses modules from these non-standard packages:
 * xhtml
 * network
 * HTTP
 * Crypto
 * parsec

There are a lot of open issues, and help is very
appreciated. A non exlusive list of TODO items is:

 * Support for tagged repositories (fetching older
   inventories)
 * Nicer output (CSS magic!)
 * (Maybe) Add repositores per gpg signed command
 * Documentation for users
 * Normalize user names (e.g. with or without full name)

When commiting patches, please make sure that they work with
the version of ghc in the latest debian stable release, at
the moment ghc6.6, and compatible libraries.

BTW, the simple darcs repository parsing code might be useful for
other projects as well. I try to keep the patches for the Darcs.hs
related stuff separate from the rest, so you can select them when
darcs pull’ing. If you also follow this procedure, we can share the
Darcs.hs code between projects, by making sure our patches to these
files can be shared without dragging in the rest of the project.
